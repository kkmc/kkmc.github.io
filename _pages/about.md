Hi, welcome to my homepage (which is a work in progress and missing things). I'm a PhD candidate in the Computer Science Department at the University of California, Berkeley. I work as a graduate student researcher associated with the ADEPT lab and I'm advised by [Sanjit A. Seshia](http://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~sseshia/).

My focuses and interests are in formal verification, programming languages, program synthesis, and system security for blockchain technology, microarchitectures, and trusted execution environments.

Before coming to Berkeley in 2017, I received my B.Sc in Combined Honours Computer Science and Mathematics at the [University of British Columbia](https://www.ubc.ca/).
