Hi, welcome to my homepage. I'm Kevin and I currently work as an Applied Scientist at AWS in the Zelkova team. I recently graduated from the [University of California, Berkeley](https://eecs.berkeley.edu/) with a Ph.D. in Computer Science where I was fortunate to be advised by by [Sanjit A. Seshia](http://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~sseshia/). During my time at Berkeley, I worked as a graduate student researcher in the Learn & Verify lab and was associated with the ADEPT/SLICE lab.

My focuses and interests are in formal verification, programming languages, program synthesis, and system security for blockchain technology, microarchitectures, and trusted execution environments.

Before coming to Berkeley in 2017, I received my B.Sc in Combined Honours Computer Science and Mathematics from the [University of British Columbia](https://www.ubc.ca/).
